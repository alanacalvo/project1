# 2048 - First Project

A simple recreation of the game 2048 using Javascipt, CSS, and HTML.

# Instructions

Use the arrow keys to merge tiles left, right, up, or down.
The goal is to continue merging until you get the tile 2048 on the game board.
If you fill up the board, the game is over.
Click new game to start fresh.

# Unfinished business

I still need to come back and add a high score counter that will save your progress each time you return.
Another goal is to play around with animation and learn how to implement that in my slide functions.
