    [x] create grid

    [] function to generate 2 random 2's in random spot on load
            // add this same functionality into keypresses to add one new 2
            // need to add conditional that requires it to add to a new spot each time
    [] 
    [x] right keypress
    [x] left keypress
    [] up keypress
    [] down keypress





    NEXT STEPS
        up and down keypress
            // directly compare each arr[at specific index]





REFACTOR CODE TO HAVE NESTED ARRAY
Pull arrays at each index into new array and rotate. - 
    rotateRight()
        .map()[arr[0] ---- IN SCREEN SHOTS ---- then .reverse()

// THINGS I LEARNED

// It's okay to start fresh. Try to evaluate whether you're making progress, or if you're stuck in a rabbit hole.
    // If you can't tell the difference, apparently you can pull down a different branch and change your path without losing all your potential progress.

// Having everything in one main function isn't necessary. I was stuck on that for so long, until someone with fresh eyes shared how it was probably 
// making things more difficult for me to comprehend (which it totally was). Once I split it up, things started making way more sense.

// I learned a lot about ifs and elses and else ifs and if elses. My brain hurts.

// I spent time talking with other engineers throughout this project. Family, TA, some of you guys, etc. I think that is a great thing to do, however, 
// it ended up ultimately hindering me because of my mindset. I learned that I have been thinking of myself as so small because I'm so new at this. 
// I would have an idea, but when someone gave another idea on how to go about something, I followed that rather than even diving into my own ideas.
// Having never gone to college and not having significant work experience, I certainly don't view myself as some software engineer genius. I value others
// opinions way more than my own, and that is something that needs to change. 
// Big example of this is that early on I thought of how to remove the zeros. I saw .filter() and thought "maybe that will come in handy." An experienced
// engineer I know said "hmmm, I don't think so." And that was enough for me to not even look past the page I was on. When I came back to refactor my project,
// I ended up coming back to it and that was a key functionality in making my game work as concisely as it does.
